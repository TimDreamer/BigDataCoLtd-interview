## Usage

npm start

## Problems

1. Blocked by CORS when accessing API.

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://od.moi.gov.tw/api/v1/rest/datastore/301000000A-000082-041' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

**Accessing JSON file instead for now.**
